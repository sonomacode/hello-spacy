ALNY, IONS, Others: Early But Definitely Interesting - Recapping Our KOL Call on AGT; Also
Inclisiran, Lp(a), APOC3, ANGPTL3
 Summary
We recently spoke with two cardiologists (Dr. Carlos Santos-Gallego, Mt. Sinai & Dr. Ken McGaffin, private practice) around the potential and promise
of AGT silencing agents, as well as other RNAi/ASO strategies in cardiovascular disease (e.g. inclisiran/PCKS9 mAbs, Lp(a), APOCIII, ANGPLT3).
The overarching view is that initial ALN-AGT clinical data are promising, and while there are some theoretical safety questions, both clinicians
conveyed optimism on the drug's potential role in refractory hypertension. The discussion was therefore bullish for ALNY, and also IONS and AKCA;
Ionis has a wholly owned AGT program in POC studies, while both AKCA/IONS participate in the upside of a NVS-partnered late-stage Lp(a) asset
which stood out as being perceived favorably. Meanwhile, both specialists are excited for the introduction of Inclisiran and the expansion of the CV treatment
armamentarium to include therapeutics effective in lowering Lp(a) (AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx) and triglycerides (-APOCIII-LRx and -ANGPTL3-LRx).
 Key Points
While Alnylam's 10mmHg reduction in systolic BP at 8 weeks for ALN-AGT is preliminary (and in a non-resistant hypertension population), both
cardiologists were excited by the decline (and clean top-line safety), and see the data as mechanistically validating. While targeting AGT via an RNAi/
ASO had always been theoretically interesting, seeing a clinically meaningful reduction in humans was an important step in the eyes of both cardiologists.
Neither physician saw the results as anything but promising for future trials; with that said, 8 weeks isn't sufficiently long to fully understand the drug's profile.
For example, Dr. Santos-Gallego pointed out that there are still unknown risks associated with silencing AGT, such as reducing levels of Ang1-7, a peptide
cleavage product of angiotensinogen which is known to be vasoprotective.
Will dual RAS blockade be an issue? One thing that's clear with AGT-targeting agents is that they'll (almost certainly) need to be used on top of the standard-
of-care; ACEs and ARBs are linchpin antihypertensives, and both suppress the RAS system. Large outcomes studies have shown that, while combining an
ACE/ARB (or layering aliskiren, another RAS-targeting agent, on top of an ACE/ARB) does indeed further reduce BP, the combinations are associated with
enough AEs (hyperkalemia and nephrotoxicity) to have no improvement on cardiovascular outcomes, with inferior renal outcomes. The specialists agreed that
today we don't fully understand the underlying mechanism of dual RAS blockade tox, noting that it's entirely an empirical finding. With that said, Dr. Santos-
Gallego noted this could theoretically be a problem because of the broad multi-organ blockade of RAS, particularly in the kidneys, which could be resolved
with ALN-AGT (or IONIS-AGT) given these are purely liver-targeting drugs which would preserve renal RAS (we've spoken with both ALNY/IONS--each make
this case mechanistically). But encouragingly, even if there does prove to be a dual RAS blockade issue with AGT silencing in the long-run, there
still remains a commercial opportunity for AGT-silencers for (1) very resistant patients, (2) patients who get weaned off ACEs/ARBs, but remain
uncontrolled on one/multiple other BP-agents or (3) in other hypertensive indications like preclampsia.
While the AGT silencers are obviously still in early-stage development, they could address a massive market opportunity. In a manner similar to
inclisiran (discussed below), compliance/adherence could be one of the biggest attractions of a theoretical ALN-AGT dosed quarterly or semiannually; this is a
huge problem, particularly in the resistant population. Both physicians see resistant hypertension patients (uncontrolled BP after 3+ antihypertensives) as the
most-obvious first target while also being a large population. Dr. McGaffin, who practices in a private practice setting estimated that at least 25% of patients
seen by specialists (ie, cardiologists) would meet these criteria. Dr. Santos-Gallego, who works in a highly specialized academic center agreed and estimated
that 50% of his more-severe patient population would be candidates.
Could AGT silencers get used by cardiologists without an outcomes trial (i.e. solely on BP lowering data?) Probably yes--if the right markers are
studied in a 1-2yr trial. While the cardiologist community has a well-earned reputation for prescribing inertia and reliance on large/lengthy CVOTs, Dr. Santos-
Gallego thinks that, particularly within the academic/hypertensive center-of-excellence community, showing a benefit on CV markers like cardiac hypertrophy
(LV mass/wall thickness), eGFR, microalbuminuria, etc. in a well-designed 1-2year trial could be sufficient to garner real usage. There was also hope that
this mechanism could even be beneficial in other populations, such as those with heart failure.
Both KOLs love the PCSK9i's (when reimbursed) but see inclisiran as potentially game-changing, if priced correctly, given the drug's far-improved
compliance (Q6M dosing vs Q2W for the mAbs). Dr. Santos-Gallego was optimistic about the success of inclisiran, contingent on pricing and ease of
use versus currently prescribed PCSK9's. Despite reimbursement hurdles in the past, Dr. McGaffin said he has not had problems with payers in the patient
population who have already had an event, or aren't at LDL goal. McGaffin has prescribed PCSK9 inhibitors to ~100-200 of his patients, and hopes to be able
to use in the average patient down the road. Dr. Santos-Gallego thinks that inclisiran could encompass ~60% of his PCSK9i usage.
We wrapped up our conversation with a brief discussion on knockdown strategies targeting Lp(a), ANGPTL3, and APOC3; the KOLs viewed all
positively. Dr. Santos-Gallego highlighted the significant unmet need associated with high levels of Lp(a) and the validated risks for MI/atherosclerosis in
patients <50. Right now, few cardiologists test for heightened Lp(a) levels even after a CV-event as there are no effective therapies are available. Given the
strong mechanistic hypothesis, Dr. Santos-Gallego expects that effective lowering of Lp(a) would reduce CV-events. Moving on to triglycerides, Dr. Santos-

Gallego views ANGPTL3 and APOC3 as equally well-validated targets, though if he had to pick one, he thinks APOC3 has a slight edge due to its direct
involvement in inhibiting triglyceride degradation.
